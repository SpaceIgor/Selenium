 Briefly describe the investment™s return on investment, including benefits
internal and external to the government and outcomes achieved or planned. 
NSF™s initial investment of $4 million to stand up and populate an enterprise data
warehouse, centralized a platform for data access, management and delivery, resulting
in direct and meaningful benefit for internal staff by providing broad access to
authoritative data and ﬁcannedﬂ reporting. Prior to the investment in a central data
warehouse, data marts were being leveraged for use by several individual organizations
with the Agency, at roughly equivalent cost to NSF™s initial enterprise investment. These
organizations could not access each other™s data and only had access to data they
wished to leverage. Continuation of this investment has proven key to meeting NSF™s
strategic priorities related to data-based decision-making, and has enabled staff to more
efficiently conduct work in support of NSF™s mission. For example, access to central,
authoritative data helps NSF staff identify areas of science that may be
underrepresented or that have gaps in terms of federal funding. NSF staff can use this
data to create reports, which can help them manage or balance their research portfolios.

 Briefly describe the investment™s return on investment, including benefits
internal and external to the government and outcomes achieved or planned. 
iTRAK™s initial implementation was on budget and on schedule, as reported previously.
Since the initial implementation and stabilization in FY15, enhancements have been
managed and implemented as planned within funding allocations. As well,
modernization of invoice payment to leverage the Treasury Invoice Processing Platform
(IPP) has allowed the iTRAK investment to greatly reduce the access of NSF staff to the
direct system and its reporting platform, thereby reducing the number of help desk
tickets and user account management actions required. These efficiencies have enabled
additional system enhancements to be implemented, improving iTRAK™s ability to
continue meeting Federal Financial Standards. Moving forward, this investment is
participating in efforts to leverage robotic process automation for certain routine financial
tasks, which will reduce the risk of manual error when entering transactions into the
system. Additional iTRAK investment benefits and planned outcomes are as follows: ·
Increase automation and integration between the financial system and NSF™s grant

NSF™s Mission Support Systems, which include applications for grants management,
proposal submission, panel reviews, award recommendations, and award confirmation,
are central to NSF™s Merit Review process. These applications serve the research
community, including researchers, educators, and students across the country who
participate in the process as well as NSF staff who manage the review of approximately
50,000 proposals for cutting-edge scientific, engineering, and education research each
year. NSF™s Mission Support Services enable the research community and NSF staff to
navigate through NSF business processes easily and quickly, and they continue to
provide effective mission-support technology solutions for NSF's ongoing grants
management needs. Additionally, the American taxpayer can leverage these services
for streamlined, transparent information regarding how their tax dollars are being used to
fund NSF awards and what outcomes those awards are achieving. As improvements are
made to internal and external-facing services, this investment will enable NSF™s
